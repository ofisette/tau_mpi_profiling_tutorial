# Tutorial: MPI profiling with Tau

This short tutorial will guide you through the basics of profiling an MPI
program using Tau. It was written as an introduction and reference for users of
the Colosse supercomputer in Qu√©bec City. However, the code examples and the
concepts discussed therein are computer-agnostic.

The tutorial is available in [English](/tutorial_en.md) and in
[French](/tutorial_fr.md).
